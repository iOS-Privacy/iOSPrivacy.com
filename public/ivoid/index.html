Included are active phishing hosts from <a href=https://www.hardenize.com><strong>Hardenize.com</strong></a>.<p>Their novel method involves the monitoring of Certificate Transparency for the acquisition of the <em>active</em> phishing domains that iVOID.hosts includes in its hosts file, thanks to the generous licensing that Hardenize has granted us.<p>iVOID.hosts is also for use with Linux workstations. It's also been tested and works well with FreeBSD, OpenBSD, &amp; NetBSD; macOS; &amp; Windows as a hosts file for <code>/etc/hosts</code> (or the equivalent relative to the OS in use). Moreover, it works well with uBlock Origin &amp; AdGuard for Firefox.<br><nav><ul><li><a href=https://gitlab.com/intr0/iVOID.GitLab.io/raw/master/iVOID.hosts><strong>iVOID on GitLab</strong></a></ul></nav><pre>https://gitlab.com/intr0/iVOID.GitLab.io/raw/master/iVOID.hosts</pre><nav><ul><li><a href=https://notabug.org/-intr0/iVOID/raw/master/iVOID.hosts><strong>iVOID on NotABug</strong></a></ul></nav><pre>https://notabug.org/-intr0/iVOID/raw/master/iVOID.hosts</pre><br><br><p><strong>download iVOID.hosts:</strong><nav><ul><li><a href=https://iosprivacy.com/ivoid/iVOID.hosts download><strong>download iVOID.hosts</strong></a></ul></nav><br><footer><a href=https://iosprivacy.com/privacy><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a></footer></main>
