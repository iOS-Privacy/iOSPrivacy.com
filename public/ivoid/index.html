Included are active phishing hosts from <a href=https://www.hardenize.com><strong>Hardenize.com</strong></a>.<p>Their novel method involves the monitoring of Certificate Transparency for the acquisition of the <em>active</em> phishing domains that iVOID.hosts includes in its hosts file, thanks to the generous licensing that Hardenize has granted us.<p>iVOID.hosts is also for use with Linux workstations. It's also been tested and works well with FreeBSD, OpenBSD, & NetBSD; macOS; & Windows 7, 8.x and 10.x (as well as XP for those who still use it) as a hosts file for <code>/etc/hosts</code> (or the equvilent relative to the OS in use). Moreover, it works well with uBlock Origin or AdGuard for Firefox.<hr><nav><ul><li><a href=https://gitlab.com/intr0/iVOID.GitLab.io/raw/master/iVOID.hosts><strong>iVOID.hosts on GitLab</strong></a></ul></nav><p><pre><code>https://gitlab.com/intr0/iVOID.GitLab.io/raw/master/iVOID.hosts</code></pre><nav><ul><li><a href=https://notabug.org/-intr0/iVOID/raw/master/iVOID.hosts><strong>iVOID.hosts on NotABug</strong></a></ul></nav><p><pre><code>https://notabug.org/-intr0/iVOID/raw/master/iVOID.hosts</code></pre><hr><br><p>To download the hosts file directly: <a href=https://ivoid.intr0.com/iVOID.hosts download><em>download iVOID</em></a>.</p><br><hr><footer><a href=https://iosprivacy.com/privacy><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a></footer><br></main>
