Included are active phishing domains from <a href=https://www.hardenize.com><strong>Hardenize.com</strong></a>. Their novel method involves the monitoring of Certificate Transparency for the acquisition of the <em>active</em> phishing domains that DomainVoider includes in its filter, thanks to the generous licensing that Hardenize has granted us.<p>DomainVoider is also for use with uBlock Origin or AdGuard for FireFox. When used with either uBlock Origin or AdGuard for Firefox, the included <code>$CSP</code> rules <code>frame-ancestors 'none'</code>, <code>upgrade-insecure-requests</code>, & <code>block-all-mixed-content</code> help to increase web security without breaking websites. The infrequent <strong>Blocked by Content Security Policy</strong> will be seen on websites that practice poor security measures - allowing the site itself to be framed by other sites, thus exposing themselves and you to clickjacking attacks; not using the security provided by <code>https://</code> with the use of a <strong>TLS certificate</strong>, and / or the inclusion within the site in question of insecure resources, whether images, videos, or any other included linked-to resource/s that do not use an encrypted <code>https://</code> connection by default. In other words, elements loaded into websites over unencrypted <code>http://</code> connections will be blocked by the <code>block-all-mixed-content</code> directive.<p>The additional <code>$CSP</code> directive <code>object-src</code> is included with a value of <code>'none'</code> to prevent <code>object</code>, <code>embed</code>, and <code>applet</code> elements from being loaded and executed on websites. The <code>object-src</code> directive restricts the URLs from which <strong>plugins</strong> may be loaded, such as Flash, a known source of continual attack vectors since its very first release. Note that this will not interfere with <strong>web extenstions</strong> / <strong>addons</strong>, such as: <strong>AdGuard, uBlock Origin, NoScript, Decentraleyes, Bitwarden & HTTPS Everywhere</strong>. It only restricts <strong>plugins</strong>, specifically from which URLs they can load. Also of interest is that the elements restricted are all obsolete according to HTML5's living standard.<hr><nav><ul><li><a href=https://gitlab.com/intr0/DomainVoider/raw/master/DomainVoider.txt><strong>DomainVoider on GitLab</strong></a></ul></nav><p><pre><code>https://gitlab.com/intr0/DomainVoider/raw/master/DomainVoider.txt</code></pre><nav><ul><li><a href=https://notabug.org/-intr0/DomainVoider/raw/master/DomainVoider.txt><strong>DomainVoider on NotABug</strong></a></ul></nav><p><pre><code>https://notabug.org/-intr0/DomainVoider/raw/master/DomainVoider.txt</code></pre><hr><br><p>To download DomainVoider directly: <a href=https://domainvoider.intr0.com/DomainVoider.txt download><em>download DomainVoider</em></a>.</p><br><hr><footer><a href=https://iosprivacy.com/privacy><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a></footer><br></main>
