Only attacks are logged &amp; those logs are rotated every 24 hours. Nothing is logged permantly; however, we will &amp; do use the temporary logs in order to secure this website against sources of malicious activity. One method used is IP blocking which does store an IP address from where attacks are launched. However, considering the fact that IP addresses are easily spoofed, altered, or hidden using various methods IP banning is only used when an IP or IP blocks such as <code>fe80::dead:beef:feed:1/64</code> or <code>192.168.0/12</code> can be verified as the actual source of malicious activity.<p>In order to help protect your privacy &amp; protect this site&#39;s security, strict <strong>http security</strong> &amp; <strong>http privacy</strong> headers are in use. These headers include <code>&#39;X-DNS-Prefetch-Control&#39;</code>, set using a value of <code>&#39;off&#39;</code> to prevent information leakage via DNS Prefetching. The <code>&#39;Clear-Site-Data&#39;</code> header is set with each of the four current values: <code>&#39;cache&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;cookies&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;storage&#39;</code> &amp; <code>&#39;executionContexts&#39;</code>; this instructs your browser to remove all relevant data upon closing your connection with our site. See <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Clear-Site-Data><strong>Clear-Site-Data</strong></a> for more information.<p>Our web &quot;host&quot;, CloudFlare, has its own <code>&#39;Set-Cookie&#39;</code> header, which is suffixed with <code>SameSite=Lax</code> &amp; prefixed with an anti-CSRF token. Our own <code>&#39;Set-Cookie&#39;</code> header is prefixed with <code>__Host-</code> &amp; suffixed with <code>SameSite=Strict</code>. These values help to thwart Cross-Site-Request-Forgery (CSRF), limit the cookie as being session-only, &amp; prevent it from being used as a tracking tool.<br><br><blockquote cite=https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies><a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies><strong>From Mozilla:</strong></a><br><br><code>__Host-</code><br>If a cookie name has this prefix, it will only be accepted in a <code>Set-Cookie</code> directive if it is marked <code>Secure</code>, was sent from a secure origin, does not include a Domain attribute, and has the Path attribute set to <code>&#x2f;</code>. In this way, these cookies can be seen as &quot;domain-locked&quot;.<br><br><code>__Secure-</code><br>If a cookie name has this prefix, it will only be accepted in a <code>Set-Cookie</code> directive if it is marked <code>Secure</code> and was sent from a secure origin. This is weaker than the <code>__Host-</code> prefix.</blockquote><br><p>Our <code>&#39;Referrer&#39;</code> header is set to <code>&#39;no-referrer&#39;</code> so that this site will not be referred-to when going to other sites; in other words, no site you may visit upon leaving this one will be told that you were here. This simple header, when set properly, greatly helps in improving your privacy when browsing the web See <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Referer_header:_privacy_and_security_concerns><strong>Referer header: privacy and security concerns</strong></a> for more information. <strong>One may alter one's &#39;referer&#39; using Add-ons availavle for FireFox designed specifically for that purpose</strong>.<p>Our <code>&#39;Content-Security-Policy&#39;</code> is one of the strongest in place among the small minority of sites that use this powerful tool. Its benefits are too numerous to enter into here; a good source for information is located on <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP><strong>Mozilla&#39;s Web Developer Network</strong></a>.<p>We use <strong>no analytics, no javascript, &amp; do not require cookies to function</strong>. Despite having the CloudFlare cookie, if you block all cookies before visiting this site, that cookie will never be set by this site (recommended). Our CSS is secured using a <code>base64-encoded sha512 hash</code>, placed directly within the link that loads the CSS. It looks something like:<br><br><code>&lt;link href=https://example.org/example.css rel=stylesheet crossorigin=anonymous integrity=&quot;sha512-example512hash==&quot;&gt;</code><br><br><p>Note that the example given is an example and does not conform to standards. The current <code>sha512-hash</code> is also listed in the <code>&#39;Content-Security-Policy&#39;</code> directives <code>style-src</code> &amp; <code>style-src-elem</code>. The <code>style-src-attr</code> directive, which controls inline styles, is set using a value of <code>&#39;none&#39;</code>. This directive, in addition to not using inline CSS, helps to protect against code injections that rely on inline CSS.<p>If the CSS in use changes in any way, the <code>sha512-hash</code> value of the CSS also changes &amp; if the CSS source URL does not equal the CSS source URL listed in <code>style-src</code> &amp; <code>style-src-elem</code>, or the <code>sha512-hash</code> value is mismatched against the current CSS loaded from the source URL, that CSS will not function.<p>Finally, <strong>ProtonMail</strong> is used for all communication. We ask that anyone who may contact us also <strong>use ProtonMail</strong> &amp; additionally <strong>use PGP</strong> as an extra layer of security &amp; privacy. The only information we receive is information voluntarily told. That said, we want to receive no personal information so we kindly ask that no one sends any. <strong>Privacy is sacred &amp; must be respected &amp; protected or it will be lost to history</strong>. Invasion of your privacy is a business, practiced by <strong>all governments &amp; all Big Brother tech companies</strong> including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, &amp; Apple. <strong>Don't allow yourself to be a product of any corporation or nation-state</strong>.<p><br><footer>End of Privacy Policy</footer></main>
