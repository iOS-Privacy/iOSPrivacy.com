This includes using strict <strong>http security</strong> &amp; <strong>http privacy</strong> headers<p>The <strong>http headers</strong> in use include the <code>&#39;X-DNS-Prefetch-Control&#39;</code> header, which is set using a value of <code>&#39;off&#39;</code> to prevent information leakage via DNS Prefetching. Our <code>&#39;Clear-Site-Data&#39;</code> header is set with each of the four current values <code>&#39;cache&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;cookies&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;storage&#39;</code> &amp; <code>&#39;executionContexts&#39;</code>; this instructs your browser to remove all relevant data when closing your connection with our site.<p>Our web host, CloudFlare, has a <code>&#39;Set-Cookie&#39;</code> suffixed with <code>SameSite=Lax</code> &amp; prefixed with an anti-CSRF token. Our <code>&#39;Set-Cookie&#39;</code> header is prefixed with <code>__Host-</code> &amp; suffixed with <code>SameSite=Strict</code>. These values help to thwart Cross-Site-Request-Forgery (CSRF), limit the cookie as being session-only, &amp; prevent it from being used as a tracking tool.<br><br><blockquote cite=https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies><a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies><strong>From Mozilla:</strong></a><br><br><code>__Host-</code><br>If a cookie name has this prefix, it will only be accepted in a <code>Set-Cookie</code> directive if it is marked <code>Secure</code>, was sent from a secure origin, does not include a Domain attribute, and has the Path attribute set to <code>&#x2f;</code>. In this way, these cookies can be seen as &quot;domain-locked&quot;.<br><br><code>__Secure-</code><br>If a cookie name has this prefix, it will only be accepted in a <code>Set-Cookie</code> directive if it is marked <code>Secure</code> and was sent from a secure origin. This is weaker than the <code>__Host-</code> prefix.</blockquote><br><p>Our <code>&#39;Referrer&#39;</code> header is set to <code>&#39;no-referrer&#39;</code> so that this site will not be referred-to when going to other sites; in other words, no site you may visit upon leaving this one will be told that you were here. This simple header, when set properly, greatly helps in improving your privacy when browsing the web.<p>Our <code>&#39;Content-Security-Policy&#39;</code> is one of the strongest in place among the small minority of sites that use this powerful tool. Its benefits are too numerous to enter into here; a good source for information is located on <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP><strong>Mozilla&#39;s Web Developer Network</strong></a>.<p>We use <strong>no analytics, no javascript, &amp; do not require cookies to function</strong>. Our CSS is secured using a <code>base64-encoded sha512 hash</code>, placed within the link that loads the CSS. It looks something like:<br><code>&lt;link href=https://example.org/example.css rel=stylesheet crossorigin=anonymous integrity="sha512-emaxple512hash"&gt;</code>.<br>Note that the example given is an example and may not conform to standards. The current <code>sha512-hash</code> is also listed in the <code>&#39;Content-Security-Policy&#39;</code> directives <code>style-src</code> &amp; <code>style-src-elem</code> within the source URL of the CSS. The <code>style-src-attr</code> directive, which controls inline styles, is set using a value of <code>&#39;none&#39;</code>. This directive, in addition to not using inline CSS, helps to protect against code injections that rely on inline CSS.<p>If the CSS in use changes in any way, the <code>sha512-hash</code> value of the CSS also changes &amp; if the CSS source URL does not equal the CSS source URL listed in <code>style-src</code> &amp; <code>style-src-elem</code>, or the <code>sha512-hash</code> value is mismatched against the current CSS loaded from source URL, that CSS will not function.<p>Finally, <strong>ProtonMail</strong> is used for all communication. We ask that anyone who may contact us also <strong>use ProtonMail</strong> &amp; additionally <strong>use PGP</strong> as an extra layer of security &amp; privacy. The only information we receive is information voluntarily told. That said, we want no personal information. <strong>Privacy is sacred &amp; must be respected &amp; protected or it will be lost to history</strong>. Invasion of your privacy is a business, practiced by <strong>Big Brother tech companies</strong> including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, &amp; Apple. <strong>Don't allow yourself to be their product</strong>.<p><code>If you desire true privacy, please use our .onion address so that your visits are encrypted &amp; anonymized via Tor.</code><br><pre>w2caclgy62idhzyut23ucimqw5tsmfbl4b2iyjzpvngatast2fiqxbyd.onion</pre><hr><footer>End of Privacy Policy</footer></main><!--/sse-->
