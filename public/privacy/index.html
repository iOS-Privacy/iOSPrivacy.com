These include the strictest <strong>http security & privacy headers</strong> in use for your protection and ours.<p>Example privacy and security headers in use include the header <strong>X-DNS-Prefetch</strong> with the value <code>off</code> to prevent the leaking of information through DNS prefetching of third-party resources linked to on our domain. The header <strong>Clear-Site-Data</strong> is set with the value of <code>*</code>, a wildcard which instructs your browser to delete any data it may have gathered such as within its cache, cookies, & storage immediately upon closing your connection with us, thus ensuring no other sites receive any information regarding your visit to this site.<p>We have a cookie header set in addition to the one set our webhost, Cloudflare. By setting our own, in addition to the <strong>Set-Cookie</strong> values of <code>HttpOnly</code>, <code>SameSite=Lax</code> & <code>Secure</code> set by Cloudflare, we have suffixed it with the value of <code>SameSite=Strict</code> & prefixed it with the value of <code>__Host-</code>, which further helps to combat <strong>Cross-Site-Request-Forgery</strong> and effectively stops it from being used as a tool for tracking you across the web.<h3>From Mozilla:</h3><blockquote cite=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies><code>__Host-</code><br>If a cookie name has this prefix, it will only be accepted in a <code>Set-Cookie</code> directive if it is marked <code>Secure</code>, was sent from a secure origin, does not include a Domain attribute, and has the Path attribute set to <code>/</code>. In this way, these cookies can be seen as "domain-locked".<br><br><code>__Secure-</code><br>If a cookie name has this prefix, it will only be accepted in a <code>Set-Cookie</code> directive if it is marked <code>Secure</code> and was sent from a secure origin. This is weaker than the <code>__Host-</code> prefix.</blockquote><p>Our <strong>Referrer</strong> header is set to <code>no-referrer</code> guaranteeing that any site you may visit after leaving here will be not be given the information that this was the site is where you were prior to going to any other site, helping to further guarantee your privacy.<p>Our <strong>Content-Security-Policy</strong> is one of the strongest in place among the small minority of sites use this powerful tool. Its benefits are too detailed to enter into here, though you may learn about it on <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP><strong>Mozilla's Web Developer Network</strong></a>.<p><strong>We use no analytics, no javascript, and require no cookies to function</strong>. Our <code>.css</code> is secured using <strong>Subresource Integrity</strong> (<code>SRI</code>), through the application of a <code>base64-encoded sha512 hash</code>, allowing it to be used only if authenticated. This effectively stops the injection of any rogue code into our stylesheet.<p>The email address we use for anyone who may want to reach us is a <strong>ProtonMail</strong> account and we request all who do contact us use a PGP key or use ProtonMail to ensure everything is encrypted prior to, during, and after transit. The only information we would ever receive from you is information you voluntarily tell us, and we would very much appreciate if you did not divulge any personal information whatsoever as <strong>privacy is sacred to the site owner, for everyone</strong>. Invasion of your privacy is a business; leave that sort of thing to Google, Amazon, Facebook, and all other <strong>Big Brother</strong> tech.<p><code>If you desire true privacy, please use our .onion address so that your visits are encrypted and anonymized via Tor.</code></p><br><hr><footer>End of Privacy Policy</footer><br></main><!--/sse-->
